# Learning-React

#### In this repository I am going to upload sample projects from the Udemy course Modern React. 

#### How to start: 
     1.Install NodeJs
     2.Run commands:
     * 'npm install' in the project root directory
     * 'npm start' in the project root directory
     3. Open 'localhost:8080'
     
     Note: Webpack will build automatically after every save
